		<h1>FAITH IN JESUS CHRIST</h1>
		<main>
			<h3>Faith is acting upon your belief that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and the Savior of the World.</h3>
			<h6>Hebrews 11:1; Alma 32:21</h6>
		<blockquote cite="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/comeuntochrist/believe/becoming-like-jesus/attributes-of-christ">
		When you have faith in Christ, you believe in Him as the Son of God, the Only Begotten of the Father in the flesh. 
		You accept Him as your Savior and Redeemer and follow His teachings. You believe that your sins can be forgiven because of His atoning sacrifice. 
		Faith in Him means that you trust Him and are confident that He loves you.

		Faith is a principle of power. God works by power, but His power is usually exercised in response to faith. 
		He works according to the faith of His children. Doubt and fear are the opposites of faith. 
		Your faith in Jesus Christ grows as you become better acquainted with Him and His teachings. 
		As you explore the scriptures, you learn of His ways, His love for all people, and His commandments.
